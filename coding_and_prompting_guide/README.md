### Assisted Coding and Prompting

- **Use Agent Mode**: 
    - Turn on Agent mode to perform file-wide edits, generate tests, manage files, and even run CLI commands directly from the terminal through natural language commands.

- **Prompt with Clarity**: 
    - Be specific in your requests. For example, instead of `fix the sidebar`, use `Update Sidebar to include X behavior under Y condition`. 
    - Provide sample inputs, expected outputs, and edge cases to get the best results.
    - If you're making a big change like major refactoring or adding complex features. Encourage deeper thinking by using phrases such as `Think hard`, `Think deep`, `Think longer`.
    - Document effective prompts, keep a record of prompts that work best and reuse them often.

- **Keep Chats Focused**: 
    - Create a new, clean chat for each distinct task. This prevents the AI's context from getting confused or hallucinating.
    - A new chat means a clean context, which leads to better results .

- **Reset Context When Needed**: 
    - If the AI starts getting confused, renaming files incorrectly, or sharing irrelevant errors, don't hesitate to start fresh with a New chat. 
    - Resetting the context cleans the AI's state and often resolves the issue.
