### Version Control and Deployment

- **Commit Early and Often**: 
    - Push your progress to GitHub regularly. 
    - This protects your work and tracks your project's history. 
    - You can also ask the agent to handle commits for you.

- **Deploy Early**: 
    - Use platforms like Vercel to deploy your app early and catch deployment issues.
